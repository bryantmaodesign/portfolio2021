                    <p class="sec-text">Lincoln had been struggling in China for a few years. Not only has the brand has had low awareness, but their brand message - "Modesty and Heritage" seems to go  against the mainstream market that values flashy and novelty. The leadership team was well aware of the urgency, and asked us to help them answer some of the big questions: What Lincoln should stand for in China now and in the future ? Who are our consumers? What does *"QuietFlight" - Lincoln's design language mean, and how will it impact the product and service in China as well as in the US?</p>
                    <p class="sec-text">The goal was to bring tangible insights to the board room that informed both  internal decisions and external communication. My role in this project was to bring the digital lens to the team and unlock the potential experience that would  tie into the brand proposition we envisaged.</p>

We took the client's team from China and the US to study shifts happening in the luxury sector of Chinese industry , built a set of future personas, and developed  the point of view (POV) of  how Lincoln might evolve in the near and distant  future. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">In phase two, we aimed to bring those POVs to life. We started the design from day one with inspiration from the analog research, field experts, and extreme consumers. We then built exemplary Lincoln user experiences and tested them  with edge consumers in both China and the US. Finally , we  evaluated the concepts with Lincoln's current consumers to see how the value proposition could relate to the business of today. From there, we sat down with key stakeholders to prioritize the concepts and sketched out the roadmap together.</p>

To get a head start, we also provided some initial ideas to prompt feedback on what the preferred direction might be. In the meeting, we captured a few sentiments which would focus our design efforts down the line:</p>

So we start our research by conducting interviews with the target group, to learn more about their pain points and needs, and what their journey looks like.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">During the session, we use low-fidelity prototypes with a co-creation exercise to facilitate conversation, collect potential ideas, and more importantly the ‘why’. We also interviewed two experts who have rich experience in membership programs and hotel services to draw inspiration from their wide exposure and edge use cases.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Finally, to put ourselves in the shoes of the user, we immerse ourselves in several Huazhu’s hotels to learn how the online and offline service operates, and how it feels as a customer.</p>

To make the process more efficient, we first map out all the features and content blocks of the app, divided them into four independent experience modules - first entry, search, service, membership, and tackle them separately.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The workflow enables us to builds quick prototypes on a daily basis to test and discuss with the client. It also helps us integrate better with the product team, raises health tension between different functional teams to decide what is really matters to their business and brand. With runs of prioritization, a core feature set has emerged that plays to Huazhu’s strength and meets its user’s needs.</p>

So, along with the feature conversation, we also collected a set of mood boards with different art directions and applied it to key screens to spark conversations with the leadership team to capture the essence of the vision - to provide affordable hotel service with integrity and elegance. The result is an image-rich, minimalist visual language that celebrates content with nature and human touch.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We knew from day one that this app needs a robust design system to grow in scale. It’s not only because it intertwines complex information with huge traffic, but also because the product belongs to a variety of businesses with different work approaches and interests. Therefore, once the key screens are in place, we start to audit all the common components, align them with the new visual identity, and transfer them into a set of guidelines and resources. The deliverable helped the in-house team to work in parallel on other parts of the app while keeping high consistency with performance.</p>
