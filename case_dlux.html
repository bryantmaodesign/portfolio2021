                    <p class="sec-text">Lincoln had been struggling in China for a few years. Not only has the brand has had low awareness, but their brand message - "Modesty and Heritage" seems to go  against the mainstream market that values flashy and novelty. The leadership team was well aware of the urgency, and asked us to help them answer some of the big questions: What Lincoln should stand for in China now and in the future ? Who are our consumers? What does *"QuietFlight" - Lincoln's design language mean, and how will it impact the product and service in China as well as in the US?
                    </p>
                    <p class="sec-text">The goal was to bring tangible insights to the board room that informed both  internal decisions and external communication. My role in this project was to bring the digital lens to the team and unlock the potential experience that would  tie into the brand proposition we envisaged.</p>

                            <p class="sec-text-dark">This project was the second phase of answering the big questions above. Phase one was all about setting the background. We took the client's team from China and the US to study shifts happening in the luxury sector of Chinese industry , built a set of future personas, and developed  the point of view (POV) of  how Lincoln might evolve in the near and distant  future. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">In phase two, we aimed to bring those POVs to life. We started the design from day one with inspiration from the analog research, field experts, and extreme consumers. We then built exemplary Lincoln user experiences and tested them  with edge consumers in both China and the US. Finally , we  evaluated the concepts with Lincoln's current consumers to see how the value proposition could relate to the business of today. From there, we sat down with key stakeholders to prioritize the concepts and sketched out the roadmap together.</p>

We spoke to various experts and extreme consumers to learn about their perspectives and aspirations, including a wellness coach, a TV scriptwriter, a China-focused economist, a Key Opinion Leader ( KOL) that held various identities, and a female entrepreneur who underwent a life stage change.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">On the experience level, we participated in a tea ceremony with a master in the Amen hotel to learn how rituals, craft, and interior design could impact people’s wellness. We also sailed with the Olympic coaches to find out what effortless meant to them. These rich insights helped us to dive deeper into each topic with fertile soil in which  to grow our ideas.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With that inspiration in mind, we quickly iterated the value proposition and created a set of concepts to test what resonated with people and why. Our first stop was Hangzhou, a fast-growing, tier two Chinese city where the citizens are well-off and open to technology,  and  a perfect test bed and alternative reference to what we found in Shanghai.  We invited eight participants based on their *future persona; namely  luxury car owners, of mixed gender and age and  with progressive attitudes towards life. We showed the concept with a set of value statements to probe their needs and aspirations toward different aspects of life. The findings helped us to narrow down our direction while setting the base tone for the design.</p>

To find out, we chose LA as our research destination as the city is well known for luxury goods and lifestyle. We recruited twelve  12 people with similar profiles and conducted the research with the same methodology we used in Hangzhou.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">By comparing the notes from China and the US, we were able to identify and prioritize opportunities that spoke to both markets and distilled the value proposition to its core message - “To be the best of you,” which was an aspiration that was is widely acknowledged by most of the consumers across the two markets.</p>

Based on Lincoln's current consumer profile, we invited eight people in Shanghai to talk about how they felt about the new brand message and concepts. Doing taht  helped us to identify some experience flaws that we could work on to further polish the design. From the positive feedback we heard, we were confident to bring the value proposition forward with the suggested key moments and concepts that Lincoln could start building from then.</p>

By combining the brand strategy with the tangible prototype, they were able to articulate a clear vision of what Lincoln’s future could be while making sound strategic decisions on how to take the first step toward their vision.</p>
