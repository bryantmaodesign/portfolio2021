In 2012, the Xprize Foundation launched the competition 'Qualcomm Tricorder,' which aims to stimulate innovation of precision diagnostics that empower individuals to make informed health decisions in their daily lives. </p>
                    <p class="sec-text">As a Taiwan electronics company, HTC sees the opportunity to combine its core technology and the local medical and R&D resources to tackle the challenge while unlocking growth in the new market. In this project, I lead a UX team to collaborate with people across disciplines. To research, design, and build the system from strategy to the prototype's launch.</p>

What's unclear is the complexity of the challenge, so we kickstart our exploration into three areas: the user's needs, the disease know-how, and technology possibility. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">By collaborating with physicians and research labs, we build prototypes in different fidelity to probe user scenarios, uncover new diagnostic methods and validate test accuracy. The limitation forces the team to think out of the box and bring unconventional solutions through the iterative cycles. The result is an integrated diagnostic system that blends digital and physical touchpoints, with proof of delightfulness and effectiveness from the real patients.</p>

So we collaborate with the leading research labs (NTU, NCU, NTHU, NCKU) in Taiwan to explore and collect cutting-edge technology from Lab-on-a-chip devices to data processing algorithms to reduce the size of the final solution massively. We then evaluate the trade-offs of each technology with engineers, build prototypes to study the impacts on experience and effectiveness, and finally identify a set of candidate as the building blocks of the system.</p>

This is the question we keep asking ourselves throughout the design journey. To answer the question, we work with QAs, Doctors, and the Xprize crew, conducting tests in different stages from concept validation to usability testing.</p>

The simple act helps us uncover many bugs and edge cases, such as battery burnout and connection problems, enabling the system to be more stable and comprehensive.</p>

While the test goal was primarily focused on diagnosis accuracy, we also discovered several pain points and opportunities to further improve the experience by observing from the side.</p>
