So, along with the feature conversation, we also collected a set of mood boards with different art directions and applied it to key screens to spark conversations with the leadership team to capture the essence of the vision - to provide affordable hotel service with integrity and elegance. The result is an image-rich, minimalist visual language that celebrates content with nature and human touch.</p>

It’s not only because it intertwines complex information with huge traffic, but also because the product belongs to a variety of businesses with different work approaches and interests. Therefore, once the key screens are in place, we start to audit all the common components, align them with the new visual identity, and transfer them into a set of guidelines and resources. The deliverable helped the in-house team to work in parallel on other parts of the app while keeping high consistency with performance.</p>
