                        <p class="sec-text-dark">We worked closely with the Huazhu team from day one. Together, we analyzed the design and performance of the app and its competitors. We conduct interviews and co-creation sessions to understand the target user, while staying at different hotels to dive deeper into the journey. </p>
                        <p class="sec-text-dark">Through rapid prototyping and iteration, we facilitate tangible discussion among different stakeholders, helping them to figure out what is truly matters to the product and brand.</p>
                        <p class="sec-text-dark">From there, we distill core experience, identify opportunities, craft a unique visual system, and consolidate it into a design system to help the Huazhu team to bring the new product to life.</p>

                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Since the app is own by different business units, we kicked off the project by conducting a series of internal interviews to understand the needs, interests, and expectations from all leaderships and functional teams, including product, sales, service, and brand. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">We audit the app to breakdown the major features while analyzing data from the current design and its competitors to learn what has been tried and how they perform. These efforts help us to onboard quickly and gather consensus on key areas for the design to explore down the line.</p>
