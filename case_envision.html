                    <p class="sec-text">Initially a Chinese B2B wind turbine provider, Envision Energy is actively expanding its portfolio and global presence in providing solutions of renewable energy and smart technology to its end consumers. However, its  weak brand message and positioning were leaving its employees working  in silos, confused about  where the company was  heading.</p>
                    <p class="sec-text">Our challenge was  to translate the CEO’s vision, “Intelligence with compassion,” into a compelling story that speaks well of what Envision is both internally and externally, be it customers, partners, or governments. My role in this project was to bring structure to  the exploration, translating the brand story into a design system that could  scale across products and services. </p>

                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Envision does not lack strategy or analysis ; what it needs is a strong narrative to connect all business units, and communicate in a way that a consumer can resonate with. Being aware of the dominant deductive culture, we instead leaned heavily on visual and audio exploration to provoke different points of view and sentiment on what the brand could be. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">The design started from day one with the brand team when audited key touch points together while building mood boards to dissect what it meant to be “Intelligence with compassion.” We then consolidated ideas into three distinct brand propositions, which were  tangible enough to trigger strong feedback and bring alignment among the stakeholders.</p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Following the chosen direction, we built prototypes in runs of iteration to define the right narrative and market position, deepen the visual expression, and see/envisage how it could scale as a system across all touchpoints. We finally converted the system into a design toolkit to help the Envision team to realise  their vision. </p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We started by meeting with leaders across business units to hear their assumptions and challenges to be ‘Envision’ while conducting brand audits with the brand team to understand their business landscape and the key touchpoints to focus on. In parallel, we used the learning we had  to expand the words “Intelligence with compassion,” by developing a set of keywords and future scenarios, building mood boards, and various narratives along the way.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We showcased our work every day in the dining area and invited all the employees to share feedback with us. This participatory process allowed us to quickly understand the company from all levels while narrowing down the proposal from nine to three distinct brand propositions - The principle of nature; The new conversation;, and Bold curiosity.</p>

We used video to tell the brand story, combining with the visual rendering on their major touch points such as the landing page, product, and data dashboard. This  rich visual expression provoked a strong sentiment among the group, helping us to drive the conversation deep into which direction to go and how it could  evolve to support Envision’s future strategy . It iwas  clear that everyone appreciated the beauty and intricacy of the first direction - the Principle of Nature, but also felt  it needed more human qualities, to show the care that Envision wanted to bring to the world.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With clear feedback from the workshop, we then dived deep into the brand narrative and how it could be  differentiated from other tech players. To do that, we first studied the  top tech brands across new ventures, startups, and enterprises in both Chinese  and global markets to Understand what the story they were telling was, and more importantly, how they delivered it to the audience. To process it more systematically, I created a framework to hold all the evidence we found to see how the storytelling format evolved at the company scale, and how its  portfolio had grown . This study not only helped us draw inspiration from those successful players but also informed us how we should position Envision for the present and future as the company evolves.</p>

The exploration became  two-fold. On the one hand, we kept writing slogans and mini-stories to extract the core elements from the narrative and used /using that to evolve the mood board to find the right look and feel for what the story was delivering. On the other hand, we used these visual elements to build and test the visual expression on the key touchpoints. This dual exploration helped us to explore multiple possibilities while keeping our ideas grounded. After countless iterations, we finally landed on a sweet spot with the brand team - a visual system that spokes elegant, constant movements, and smooth transitions.</p>

Since digital would l play a significant role in their future portfolio, I worked closely with our visual lead to apply the brand system extensively on every digital component we could  imagine - the enterprise website, the EnOS Dashboard, the smart building app, the mobile charger interface, or even the employee's smart badge. To further test the system, we invited our partner team, who were working on the client’s smart building project, to adopt our brand system in their work. This rigorous process helped us to foresee any potential gaps and fill them before we handed it to the brand team.</p>
